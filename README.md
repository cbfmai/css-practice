### 3.2 Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

-[x] Inline style (inside an HTML element)
-[x] External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
-[x]  Browser default

So, an inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the <head> tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.
